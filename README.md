# Functionality

## API Requests

- Added Sort by
- Added filter:
  - min / max price fields
  - first two checkboxes for price, style, colour, and flush type
- Added pagination which reflects the products requested

## Extra

- Added in a product route to view the product on its own page as a small example of routing in react
- Mostly matches the original mockup design with the odd exception of detail; this is not developed with a mobile first approach
